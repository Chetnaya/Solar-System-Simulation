This, an interactive solar system simulation is one of the first projects I did as an introduction to the interface of Unity software. 
The game is playable on browser and there is a C# script through which, whatever planet the user clicks on, the main camera's focus shifts onto that specific planet. 
This small project helped me build my basic foundation in 3D environments in Unity.
